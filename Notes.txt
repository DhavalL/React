Javascript Arrow Function:https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-arrow-functions/

Don't define function using "function" keyword in function definition in react.

React JS uses JSX. (syntax extension to JavaScript)
React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid.

example:
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

Babel converts JSX to Javascript.

We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.
