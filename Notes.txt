Javascript Arrow Function:https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-arrow-functions/

Don't define function using "function" keyword in function definition in react.

React JS uses JSX. (syntax extension to JavaScript)
React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid.

example:
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

Babel converts JSX to Javascript.

We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.

JSX Prevents Injection Attacks.

Props can be any name(?).state cannot.
we may have more than one ReactDOM methods.

onClick, onChange, etc event function starts with ()=>{} not directly {} in tag

no state manipulation in render method. (pure function)

ctrl+del to remove all spaces in any editors.

Binding:

if function is arrow function in argument then binding is not required.

not getElementById, instead use JSX in tag property

binding methods:http://stackinsight.blogspot.com/2019/01/handle-events-react.html

installed babel/sublime extension and esLint (for error checking)

props passing in constructor is used to use of props in state in constructor. without it props can be undefined.

JSX is converted to React.createElement('div',{class},React.getElementById...) So importing React is must.

Component name should be start with capital character.
