Representational State Transfer(REST)-2000 Roy Fielding.



Architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems
-Hypermedia is an extension of hypertext & nonlinear medium(ex. harddrive,phonebook, ie. accessed or written in nonlinear) of information, multimedia presentation of non-linear forms

like in dotnet,php, the view is rendered or compiled at server-side, but with REST API, the data is sent by server and using that the client script render the view.

Guiding Principles:
Client-Server:
for no dependency on each other

Stateless:
Server won't store any client request. So treat each request as new. No session,no history. Client manages state.

Cacheable
caching response
client cache is given right to reuse that

Uniform interface
To define such an interface (contract between the client and the service), you have to use standards. like identification of resources(URI), manipulation, self-descriptive messages, hypermedia as the engine of application state.
Interface between components must be the same. Ie. between client and server and any intermediaries, all of which are components.

Layered system
Deployed on server A, data stored on B, auth in C.

Code on demand
executable software code from a server computer to a client computer on demand to download and execute as a script.
